# Recast

## Motivation
Recast is a tool to help keep you sane while listening to old podcasts. When a podcast has been around for a while, it can be overwhelming to go through the whole 700 episodes.

With Recast, you can rerun the podcast by a set delay. It is as if the show is still running.

## Usage
Construct a url as such:

```
https://racast-re3ypjdama-uc.a.run.app/rss?url=<rss feed link of your feed>&delay=<number of hours>
```

Put it in your favourite podcast app and you are good to go.
